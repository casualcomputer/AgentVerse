MOTION TO SUPPRESS EVIDENCE

Defendant John Johnson, by and through his attorneys, Smith & Associates, hereby moves this Court for an order suppressing all evidence obtained from the search of his residence located at 123 Main Street, New York, NY, on April 15, 2023, and all fruits thereof. The search warrant lacked probable cause, contained material misrepresentations, and was executed in an unreasonable manner in violation of Mr. Johnson's rights under the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution.

BACKGROUND FACTS

On April 15, 2023, agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation executed a search warrant at Mr. Johnson's residence. The warrant purported to authorize the seizure of all electronic devices, financial records, and communications relating to TechFuture, Inc. and its investors from January 1, 2018, to the present.

The affidavit in support of the warrant relied primarily on statements from a confidential informant who had previously provided unreliable information to law enforcement and who had a financial interest in the outcome of this investigation. Moreover, the affidavit omitted material facts regarding the informant's credibility and motivation.

ORDER ON DEFENDANT'S MOTION TO SUPPRESS

Upon consideration of Defendant's Motion to Suppress Evidence (Dkt. 28), the Government's Opposition (Dkt. 32), and oral argument held on August 15, 2023, the Court hereby DENIES Defendant's motion.

The Court finds that the search warrant was supported by probable cause. The affidavit provided sufficient factual information from multiple sources, including the confidential informant, corroborating financial records, and electronic communications independently obtained by investigators. Although the defendant challenges the reliability of the confidential informant, the Court finds that the information provided by the informant was sufficiently corroborated by other evidence.

The Court further finds that the execution of the warrant was reasonable and within the scope authorized by the warrant. The agents conducted the search during daylight hours, provided the defendant with a copy of the warrant, and limited their seizure to items within the scope of the warrant.

Accordingly, Defendant's Motion to Suppress is DENIED.

SO ORDERED.

VOLUNTARY PETITION FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11

Smith Corporation, a Delaware corporation with its principal place of business at 789 Retail Avenue, Wilmington, Delaware, hereby submits this voluntary petition for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

The Debtor estimates its assets to be between $10,000,000 and $50,000,000 and its liabilities to be between $50,000,000 and $100,000,000.

The Debtor has 28 retail locations across the Mid-Atlantic region and employs approximately 350 individuals. The company has suffered significant financial distress due to the changing retail landscape, increased competition from online retailers, and the lingering effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer shopping habits.

Through this Chapter 11 case, the Debtor seeks to restructure its obligations, renegotiate certain leases, and implement a revised business model that will allow it to remain competitive in the current retail environment.
